 <h2>What does Opera Do?</h2>
  <p>Opera has originated features later adopted by other web browsers, including: Speed Dial, pop-up blocking, reopening recently closed pages, private browsing, and tabbed browsing. Additional features include a built-in screenshot tool, Snapshot, which also includes an image-markup tool; built-in ad blockers, and tracking blockers.One security feature is the option to delete private data, such as HTTP cookies, browsing history, items in cache and passwords with the click of a button. When visiting a site, Opera displays a security badge in the address bar which shows details about the website, including security certificates. Opera's fraud and malware protection warns the user about suspicious web pages and is enabled by default. It checks the requested page against several databases of known phishing and malware websites, called blacklists.</p>
 
 <h2>So why Opera?</h2>
  <p>Opera has a very easy system to get used too, as well as having a feature where you can upload your previous tabs and styles from other browsers like google or safari from just linking the two.If your a <strong>gamer</strong>, Opera also has a place on the home page dedicated to new releases and updates. Another thing on the home page is easy to access apps like facebook, youtube, whatsapp, etc.</p>
